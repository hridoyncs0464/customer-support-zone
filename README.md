What is the useState hook, and how does it work?
Answer:The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.
The useState() hook allows you to add state to functional components in React. It works by:

1. Initialize State: When you call useState(initialValue), it creates a state variable and an updater function.

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
2. State is Preserved Across Renders: React remembers the state value between re-renders of the component. Each time the component renders, React keeps the latest value of count.

3. State Updates with the Updater Function: When you call setCount(newValue) React updates the state and it re-renders the component to reflect the new state value.

<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
4. Triggers Re-render: React will re-render only the component where useState was usedâ€”ensuring your UI updates automatically when the state changes.

How can you share state between components in React?
